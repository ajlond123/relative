# Relative Insight - Front-end Test

**Adam Lond**

I chose to focus on the page manager section of the brief/design
and so all the other sections are purely decorative.

The functional parts of the page manager are as follows: -

- `Export all` - this toggle selects/deselects exporting 
all the pages.
- The page checkboxes.
- Each page slide can be dragged into a new position 
within the list, and the list numbering reorders on drop.
